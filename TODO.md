# Hold off to do for reviewers?
Here are ideas I like and want to add. Hopefully the reviewers will ask some of the questions I expect.

# Other agents
1. Max entopy exploration
2. ELBO/count-based exploration
3. Extrinsic reward exploration 

# Curiosity cat?
1. Train a VAE->MLP classifier with 
    - random batches
    - softmax E batches
    - argmax E batches
2. Finetune a pretained-SOA model using determined curiosity? 
    - Can curiosity further improve the state of the art?

# ImageInfoBandits
- Leaning w/ VAE

# Foraging tasks
1. A grid-maze
2. A scent landscape
3. A patch world
